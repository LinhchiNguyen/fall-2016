## Assessing Your Community's Needs

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
  - Students interested in tech and entrepreneurship but do not have the means and connections to start.
  - CS is the most popular major at Princeton, but most people go to work in large companies since they do not think entrepreneurship is an option for them.
  - People who join startups or found ones often already have connections (eg. live in the Bay Area, have friends who found startups, etc.) and the demographics of such people are not very diverse. 

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
	 - ~350 declared Computer Science majors
	 - ~150 people in Entrepreneurship Club
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community? 
	- I don't have a specific number of people I would like to join, but I would like to include more people who were never exposed to tech or entrepreneurship before college into this group.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change? 
	-  CS has only become the most popular major in the last two years and replaced Operations and Financial Engineering as the most popular engineering major. Its popularity is probably due to the attractiveness of salary for software engineers and the broad requirements of the major.


### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech? 
	-  E-Club
	- ACM
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons? 
	- E-Club startup classes
	- ACM bi-monthly Code@Night
	- Nearby hackathons (HackRU, HackNY, etc.)

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community? 
	- E-Club events such as HackPrinceton and Startup Classes are open to everyone
	- However to join E-Club people would need to go through a selective application process, which prevents many people who do not get accepted from joining the community
	- ACM Code@Night is open to everyone
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working? 
	-  Generally no as events are often at night or on the weekends
- Is there childcare available? 
	-  No
- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities? 
	-  Princeton provides accommodations to students with disabilities

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that? 
	-  Most of them are CS students or freshmen who are interested in the major. I would like to encourage more people who do not know CS to try out tech.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific? 
	-  Everyone seems to have diverse interest

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community? 
	- They are college students hoping to explore different career paths, especially in entrepreneurship and tech
- Are they students hoping to get a degree? Yes
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job? Yes
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major? Maybe. 
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals? 
	-  Making projects for beginners: they often are the ones who would like to start learning developing but are intimidated to join existing projects or start new ones
	- Mentorship with older students
	- Connections with alumni at early-stage startups

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather? 
	-  On campus
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet? 
	-  There is a entrepreneurship hub off campus where E-Club usually gather. Other activities mostly stay around CS building.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups? No
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus? Yes
- How much does it cost to use the space? None
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings? Very flexible
- How many people can it fit? 50-100
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes? Yes
- Is there water or snacks available nearby? Yes

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another? 
	-  Mostly email
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel? 
	- Slack or email. We have an E-Club Facebook group but it is not very active.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating? 
	- More in-person meetings might be ideal 

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas? 
	-  Very welcoming, but it might be a competitive process to get approval to start something new in E-Club
