### Fall 2016 Repo

The [Fall 2016 Repo](https://github.com/campus-experts/fall-2016) is your cohort's repository (you're looking at it now!). You'll use this repo to access all program resources like the schedule of activities, but you can also open issues with questions or bugs you find. As you develop artifacts throughout the program, you'll also open Pull Requests against this repo to collaborate with other Campus Experts.

### Your Fork

During week 1, you'll be directed to fork the Fall 2016 repo into your personal account. Your forked repo will house your program artifacts. You'll solicit feedback from other Campus Experts via a Pull Request against the Fall 2016 Repo.

### Office Hours

Office hours will be hosted [on Zoom](https://github.zoom.us/j/550401935) each week. We've scheduled 3 office hours each week: one for each major region's time zones. You don't need to attend all 3 office hours each week, but you should attend at least one. In the event that you are unable to attend one of the 3 office hours, a recording will be made available. Some weeks (like Week 1) will contain structured content. Other weeks will contain unstructured time for Q&A with the facilitators and other Campus Experts. Although the office hours are titled by region, you can attend whichever event is convenient for you.

Here are the days for each set of office hours:
